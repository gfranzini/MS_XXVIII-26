MS_XXVIII-26
=============

Digital edition and transcription of manuscript V, Verona, XXVIII(26): the oldest surviving manuscript of Augustine's _De civitate Dei_.
For more information, please visit: http://decivitatedei.eu

## About
_De civitate Dei_ is traditionally made up of 22 volumes. MS XXVIII(26), however, preserves only books 11-16 (254 pages) along with 9th century _capitula_ and back matter.

While initially comparing the manuscript to a standard edition, I'm in the process of collecting transcriptions and images of a handful of 5th-8th century witnesses with a view to further enhancing the edition.


## Editorial information
The manuscript is encoded in accordance with [EpiDoc](http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/) standards, a subset of the TEI framework.  

### Scholia
The manuscript contains marginal annotations, also known as _scholia_, which are often difficult to read due to damage to the text. Where illegible, a `<!--comment-->` is used as a placeholder for future reference. The same approach applies to damaged pages.
